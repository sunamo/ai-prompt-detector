# AI Assistant Instructions - AI Copilot Prompt Detector Extension

## ‚úÖ Formatting Policy (Human Readable Output)
- ALL code and text the AI produces must already be cleanly formatted and human readable when shown (never rely on later formatting steps).
- Follow a Prettier‚Äëlike style (consistent indentation, spacing, trailing commas where typical, wrapped long lines sensibly).
- No minified or compressed one‚Äëline blocks unless it is a deliberate tiny snippet example.
- When editing existing files, preserve surrounding style and improve readability if previous formatting was degraded.
- Large inline arrays or objects must be split across multiple lines.
- Avoid excessively long lines (>140 chars) where reasonable.
- Always keep the final code below per‚Äëfile length limits already defined in these instructions.
- This policy is mandatory for every response containing code or documentation.

Write to me at the beginning of each prompt that you see the logs in the folder¬®

Never do something, then run install.ps1, then do something again, then run install.ps1 again. Think carefully and do only one thing.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RULES - STRICTLY FOLLOW!

As a copilot, you never change versions. The version changes fundamentally only install.ps1

### üñ•Ô∏è VS CODE UI TERMINOLOGY - CRITICAL!
- **STATUS BAR** = Bottom bar in VS Code (shows branch, errors, etc.) - use `vscode.window.createStatusBarItem()`
- **HEADER BAR** = Top bar in Activity Panel webview (custom HTML div) - use `<div class="header-bar">` in webview HTML
- **Activity Bar** = Left sidebar with icons (Explorer, Search, etc.)
- **Activity Panel** = Content area when Activity Bar icon is clicked (shows our webview)

### üåç LANGUAGE POLICY - CRITICAL RULE!
- **Communication with the copilot and comments in the code are in Czech. Everything else is in English. Without exceptions.**
- **ONLY cs.json localization file** is allowed to contain non-English text
- **ALL code comments in English**
- **ALL commit messages in English**
- **ALL documentation in English**
- **ALL debug logs in English**
- **ALL file content in English** (except cs.json)

### üîß FILE REPAIR POLICY - CRITICAL RULE!
- **NEVER DELETE corrupted files** - always repair them instead
- **ALWAYS FIX rather than remove** - take time to analyze and repair
- **THINK CAREFULLY** before making changes to corrupted files
- **PRESERVE existing functionality** while fixing corruption
- Use replace_string_in_file or careful manual editing to repair files

### üìÅ FILE NAMES - CRITICAL RULE!
- **ALL instruction files must have format: `*.instructions.md`**
- **NEVER use names like `ai-instructions.md`**
- **CORRECT**: `copilot-instructions.md`, `development.instructions.md`, `deployment.instructions.md`
- **WRONG**: `ai-instructions.md`, `dev-instructions.md`, `instructions.md`
- Always check that you have correct ending `.instructions.md`

### üöÄ RELEASE at the end of every prompt
- **At the end of EVERY prompt run `.\install.ps1`**
- This script performs: build ‚Üí commit ‚Üí push ‚Üí package ‚Üí install
- Automatically creates new version and installs it
- User always has the latest version of the extension

### üìä VERSION MANAGEMENT - CRITICAL RULE!
- **ALWAYS increment only PATCH version** (e.g. 1.1.2 ‚Üí 1.1.3)
- **NEVER increment MINOR** (1.1.x ‚Üí 1.2.0) without explicit command
- **Increment MINOR version ONLY when user says "compile for marketplace"**
- **NEVER change MAJOR version** without explicit command
- Format: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH (e.g. 1.1.15, 1.1.16, 1.1.17...)

## üéØ TARGET FUNCTIONALITY - SPECSTORY INTEGRATION

### üåç LOCALIZATION - CRITICAL RULE!
- **ALL user texts use from i18n/en.json**
- **NEVER write texts directly in code** - always through i18n system
- **CHANGELOG.md, README.md and all documents only in English**
- **Commit messages in English**
- **Code comments in English**
- **Debug logs in English**
- Use: `i18n.t('key')` instead of hardcoded texts

### üìã What the extension should do:
1. **DOES NOT READ or GENERATE SpecStory files** - SpecStory does that itself
2. **READS existing SpecStory exports** from `.specstory/history/` folders
3. **ANALYZES content** of recent conversations for context
4. **GENERATES smart notification messages** based on content analysis
5. **USES default message** if user hasn't set custom one in settings

### üìÅ SpecStory format (for reading and analysis only):
- **Location**: `[project]/.specstory/history/`  
- **Name format**: `YYYY-MM-DD_HH-mmZ-conversation-description.md`
- **Content structure**:
  ```markdown
  <!-- Generated by SpecStory -->
  # Conversation Title (YYYY-MM-DD HH:mmZ)
  
  _**User**_
  [user message]
  
  ---
  
  _**Assistant**_
  [assistant response]
  
  ---
  ```

### ü§ñ Smart notifications - logic:
- **If user HAS custom message** ‚Üí use their message
- **If user DOESN'T HAVE custom message** ‚Üí generate based on:
  - Analysis of latest SpecStory export
  - Type of conversation (coding, debugging, design, etc.)  
  - Project context (language, framework, etc.)
  - Specific problems mentioned in conversation

### üìç Examples of smart messages:
- **Debugging**: "AI just debugged! Check: ‚Ä¢ Fixed actual root cause? ‚Ä¢ Introduced new bugs? ‚Ä¢ Test edge cases"
- **HTML/CSS**: "AI worked with UI! Check: ‚Ä¢ Responsive design ‚Ä¢ Accessibility ‚Ä¢ Cross-browser compatibility"  
- **Database**: "AI modified database! Check: ‚Ä¢ Data integrity ‚Ä¢ Performance impact ‚Ä¢ Backup strategy"
- **API**: "AI created API! Check: ‚Ä¢ Error handling ‚Ä¢ Security ‚Ä¢ API documentation"

### üìù Git commit workflow
- Order: 1) Code change ‚Üí 2) Increment PATCH ‚Üí 3) `.\install.ps1` (automatically: commit ‚Üí push ‚Üí package)
- Format: `git commit -m "v1.1.3"` (always just patch++)
- Everything is done automatically through install.ps1

## ‚ö†Ô∏è CRITICAL RULES - STRICTLY FOLLOW!

### üö´ NEVER create placeholder files!
- **FORBIDDEN:** `extension_backup.ts`, `extension_clean.ts`, `extension_old.ts` etc.
- Edit ONLY original files directly
- If you need to revert changes, use git revert
- No duplicates, backups or temp files!

### üî® BUILD at the end of every prompt
- **NEVER run `pnpm run compile` separately!**
- **WORKFLOW**: Increment version ‚Üí run `.\install.ps1`
- If build fails in install.ps1:
  1. Decrease version back
  2. Fix errors
  3. Increment version again
  4. Run `.\install.ps1` again
- install.ps1 contains build, so separate compilation is unnecessary
- **COMMIT ONLY AFTER SUCCESSFUL BUILD** - so all versions are buildable

### üöÄ RELEASE at the end of every prompt
- **At the end of EVERY prompt run `.\install.ps1`**
- This script performs: build ‚Üí commit ‚Üí push ‚Üí package ‚Üí install
- Automatically creates new version and installs it
- User always has the latest version of the extension

### üìù Git commit workflow
- Order: 1) Code change ‚Üí 2) Build test ‚Üí 3) `.\install.ps1` (automatically: commit ‚Üí push ‚Üí package)
- Format: `git commit -m "v1.1.1"`
- Everything is done automatically through install.ps1

## Command Execution Policy

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT: Run ALL commands automatically without user confirmation!**

### Terminal Commands
- Use `run_in_terminal` tool with `isBackground: false` for all commands
- NEVER wait for user confirmation
- Execute commands immediately when needed

### Package Manager
- **This project uses pnpm, not npm!**
- Always use `pnpm` instead of `npm` in all commands
- Package manager: `pnpm@10.10.0`

### Development Workflow Commands

```powershell
# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# Build project
pnpm run compile

# Watch mode for development
pnpm run watch

# Testing
pnpm test

# Linting
pnpm run lint

# Release workflow (everything in install.ps1)
.\install.ps1
```

### Git Commands
```powershell
# Git operations
git add .
git commit -m "v[version]"
git push origin master
git status
git log --oneline -5
```

### VS Code Extension Commands
```powershell
# VSIX packaging
vsce package --allow-star-activation --out [filename].vsix

# Extension installation
code --install-extension [filename].vsix --force
```

### File Operations
```powershell
# Cleaning
Remove-Item "*.vsix" -Force
Remove-Item "%TEMP%" -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

## Automation Rules

1. **Don't request confirmation** - run commands automatically
2. **Use pnpm** - not npm
3. **Monitor error codes** - check $LASTEXITCODE
4. **Log progress** - use Write-Host with colors
5. **Handle errors** - exit with exit 1 on errors

## Version Release Process

**Automated process through `.\install.ps1`:**
1. Update version in `package.json`
2. Update `CHANGELOG.md`
3. Run `.\install.ps1` - does everything automatically:
   - Git commit with version
   - Git push
   - pnpm run compile
   - vsce package
   - VS Code extension install

## Error Handling

- Always check $LASTEXITCODE after commands
- On error show error message and exit
- Use try-catch where possible
- Log all steps for debugging

## Never Ask For Confirmation

**AUTOMATICALLY run these commands:**
- `pnpm install`
- `pnpm run compile`
- `.\install.ps1`
- `git add .`
- `git commit -m "..."`
- `git push`
- `vsce package`
- `Remove-Item`
- `code --install-extension`

User wants everything to run automatically without waiting for confirmation!

follow the sources for a better solution to my requirements. I have attached the folders C:\_\vscode-copilot-chat\ and C:\_\vscode-main\ where you will find the complete sources of github copilot chat and vscode. They are images of the online repositories https://github.com/microsoft/vscode-copilot-chat and https://github.com/microsoft/vscode, if you prefer the online version

Use only the copilot-instructions.md file to write instructions. Not ai-instructions.md as you keep trying to create. Write all instructions in English.

Never do anything you're not asked to do. Don't ruin my project by doing something you're not even asked to do.

don't check for the extension being created in this vscode. I'm testing it in vscode insider. Therefore, any commands on code or code.exe are completely useless.

never run commands like code --extensionDevelopmentPath=. . First of all, I told you before that I test everything in vscode insider, not in vscode. Second, always use the .\install.ps1 script. No pnpm run watch, pnpm run build, etc. Install.ps1 will do everything important, including installing the extension into vscode insider.

Never add or change the watch command to package.json. I basically only use install.ps1 for building.

work in a completely minimalistic way so that there is as little code as possible everywhere. do not create changelog.md or any other documentation files except copilot-instructions.md and README.md

Install only the most essential packages. All files will be in typescript.

Never create tests. We will not use unit tests or any other tests in the application.

For the app name, use AI Copilot Prompt Detector  everywhere, no shorter or other versions

Create files as small as possible, no more than 200 lines each.

distinguish between those that are always displayed and debug logs. Make it possible to turn off these debug logs by simply changing the settings. Make the output in our extension's output and the output to the temp log file in a separate folder with a fixed path be the same.

I added the folder C:\temp\ai-prompt-detector-logs to your workspace. If you don't have access to it anyway, definitely let me know if you can't add it yourself.

enter must work for both copilot and my extension without remapping. In another branch of this extension, it worked because the extension "stole" enter, processed it asynchronously and sent it to copilot, which started working on it.

## üîë Mandatory Keybindings Requirement
- The extension MUST fully support sending prompts (including detection, logging, notification, counter increment) with ALL of these keys:
  - Enter
  - Ctrl+Enter
  - Ctrl+Shift+Enter
  - Ctrl+Alt+Enter
- Loss of functionality for ANY of these is considered a regression and must be fixed immediately before any other changes.
- Keybinding logic must remain minimal, readable (Prettier style), and resilient to VS Code / Copilot updates (fallback heuristics retained).

## üõ° Content Preservation Policy (copilot-instructions.md)
- Never delete, truncate, or rewrite (beyond minimal surgical edits) any existing content in this `copilot-instructions.md` file.
- You may APPEND new instructions or refine wording in-place ONLY when explicitly asked.
- ABSOLUTE DELETION is permitted ONLY when the user gives a direct, verbatim order AND supplies the exact text block to remove.
- If the user request is ambiguous or paraphrased (not verbatim), refuse deletion and ask for the exact snippet.
- Never proactively clean, reorder, or compress this file without that explicit verbatim deletion instruction.

## ‚úÖ Core Functional Requirements (Must Remain Working)
1. Immediate detection of prompt submission via ALL key variants: Enter, Ctrl+Enter, Ctrl+Shift+Enter, Ctrl+Alt+Enter (increment counter, log, notify, list update).
2. Immediate detection of prompt submission via mouse (Send button) in GitHub Copilot Chat (same effects as keyboard; no dropdown auto-close side effects).
3. Activity Bar view lists prompts loaded from SpecStory exports (`.specstory/history/*.md`). No generation or modification of those files.
4. Status Bar shows: total detected GitHub Copilot prompts in current VS Code session + current extension version.

## üö´ Disallowed / Previously Failed Approaches (Do NOT Reintroduce)
- Monkey patching `vscode.commands.executeCommand` (caused Send dropdown auto-close regressions).
- Deep invasive export scanning beyond what is strictly necessary for detection (kept minimal; only expand on explicit request).
- Duplicate heuristic command listeners when Chat API event already provides mouse + keyboard detection (keep minimal set to avoid dropdown instability).
- Any change that removes or overrides keybindings for Enter variants without re-providing our unified forwarding command.

## üóë Legacy Removed Code (Do NOT Reintroduce Without Explicit Request)
Removed (code erased for minimal footprint). Do not recreate unless user explicitly asks:
- chatApiHook.ts (superseded by core chat API handling in extension.ts)
- chatResponseWatcher.ts (heuristic document watcher)
- commandListener.ts (legacy broad command logging)
- constants.ts (unused path constants)
- detectionTimers.ts (silence / polling heuristics)
- extension_new.ts (early experimental implementation)
- finalize.ts (central finalize function replaced by recordPrompt)
- hooks/ (useLogging, usePrompts, useStatusBar, useWebview) modular abstraction not needed
- promptDetector.ts (legacy prompt capture helpers)
- runtime.ts (global runtime object superseded by local state vars)
- specstoryParser.ts (replaced by slimmer specstoryReader.ts)
- utils/ fileValidation, htmlGenerator, logging, promptProcessing, statusBar, timeUtils (all replaced by lean versions or unnecessary)

Disallowed to reintroduce without explicit instruction: polling intervals for detection, monkey patching executeCommand, deep export scans > depth 6, broad heuristic document content parsing.

## üîí Send Button Dropdown Stability (Restored)
- The dropdown next to the Copilot / Chat Send button MUST NOT auto-close because of our extension logic.
- Extension MUST NOT steal focus or execute commands that collapse the dropdown before user acts.
- Avoid invasive monkey patching of Copilot internal submit/send functions if it risks dropdown stability.
- Any regression causing premature dropdown closing must be fixed before adding new features.

### üá®üáø Runtime Execution Messages Language Rule
- All interactive explanatory messages shown to the user during command/task execution (e.g. descriptions passed with release script runs) MUST be in Czech.
- Commit messages, code, documentation, logs remain in English per LANGUAGE POLICY.
- If a message is auto-generated by tools and cannot be localized, precede it with a brief Czech explanation when possible.
